RHCSA Study Journey: Week 2

Going through the basic commad syntax for Linux this week

ls  #will display a listing of information about files

Note: Linux is case sensitve and inputting LS would give you permission denied if the path does not exist

ls Documents  #Documents is a direcetory and in this Linux command ls is being give the argument of Documents which should return an output list of files contained withing the Documents directory.

ls -l #tThe -l is an option that gives the ls more information on the each of the files listed

ls -r #The -r will print the results in reverse alphabetical order

ls -l -r #Returns a long (detailed) listing with the order reversed

pwd #Is the printing working directory

cd Documents #Puts you in the Documents directory as show below
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ 

~/Documents/$ cd School/Art #Puts you in the Art directory as shown below
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents/School/Art$

~/Documents/School/Art$ pwd #Will confirm the change into the Art directory

~/Documents/School/Art$ cd .. #Will move you to the School directory

~/Documents/School$ cd ~ #The ~ will take you to the user's home directory

ls -l /var/log/
